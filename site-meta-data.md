    Product designer at Government Technology Agency, Singapore // previously,
    UX intern at Cargill, Inc.


    I currently view design as a tool to either empower those next in line to do their best work, or build trust between users and emerging technologies.
about: >-
  I'm currently a product designer at the Government Technology Agency in
  Singapore working on Singpass, the nation's digital identity platform for
  citizens.


  I was born and raised in sunny Singapore before going to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the United States (where winters are harsh) to study industrial design. 


  I made a 180-deg pivot from a science-based education (pre-college) to graduating with a fine arts degree, then became a product designer in tech.
