HackIllinois is one of the largest collegiate hackathons with 1000+ participants annually. As a hackathon that focuses on contributions to open source software, we also bring in dedicated mentors for the 36-hour event. 

For [HackIllinois 2020](https://2020.hackillinois.org/), I led UI/UX design, and was the primary designer for 3 of the 4 digital products - the website, mobile app for both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hackillinois/id1451755268#?platform=iphone) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hackillinois.android.release), and an event dashboard that spans 3x3 monitors. Additionally, I moved the organizing team of 50 members to Figma for easier collaboration and developer handoff.

Design team: [Charlotte Peloquin](https://charlottepeloquin.com/) (design director), [Hayley Peterson](https://happygohayley.com/), [Abrielle Bujack](https://abriellebujack.com/), Alli Nitti, [Joanna Bryne](https://joannabyrne.me/), and me.

# App

The app was designed to be similar on both devices using Google Material Design, except for the countdown timer on the home screen. The apps also used their native maps API.
