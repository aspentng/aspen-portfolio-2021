HackIllinois is one of the largest collegiate hackathons with 1000+ participants annually. As a hackathon that focuses on contributions to open source software, we also bring in dedicated mentors for the 36-hour event. 

For HackIllinois 2020, I led UI/UX design, and was the primary designer for 3 of our 4 products - the website, mobile app for both iOS and Android, and an event dashboard that spans 3x3 monitors. Additionally, I moved the organizing team of 50 members to Figma for easier collaboration and developer handoff.

Design team: [Charlotte Peloquin](https://charlottepeloquin.com/) (design director), [Hayley Peterson](https://happygohayley.com/), [Abrielle Bujack](https://abriellebujack.com/), Alli Nitti, [Joanna Bryne](https://joannabyrne.me/), and me.
