# Overview

Given a projected market size of USD 1.33 Billion by 2027, it seems like it's only a matter of time before autonomous vehicles hit the streets of the world.

With the imminent rise of autonomous vehicles, how might we help the general public to curb their skepticism and fear of riding a L5 autonomous vehicle? *\[note: L5 vehicles are fully automated with no steering wheels or pedals]*

Assumption/Constraint: Due to the timeframe of the project, I made the intentional decision to not involve the physical aspects of the car (e.g. did not explore what it'll be like to have a screen in the vehicle).

# Approach

(1) Did research to understand the landscape of the self-driving vehicle space, including chatting with professors, engineers and designers from Waymo.

(2) Reviewed literature and studies on the progress of autonomous vehicles from the perspective of users.

(3) Learned about the factors that affect how trust is formed between humans or humans and products.

(4) Conducted informal user interviews to learn about parallel experiences (e.g. ride sharing or buying a used vehicle) and their general sentiments about self-driving.

# Overarching Principle (synthesized from research)

Users want to maintain a level of control or feel like they are able to intervene in the situation when they feel the need to.

# Proposed Solution

An app that allows first-time riders (or seasoned riders) to customize their autonomous vehicle experience by setting certain preferences. 

In reality, when these vehicles are approved to operate on the streets, they will operate within a set of safe and fixed settings, and there is nothing to worry about. This app puts a small amount of control in the hands of the users to help them ease into this entirely new experience.

This idea was inspired by a music equalizer, where there are preset settings for quick selection, but users also have the ability to perform more in-depth customization.

Through research, I found that (1) maximum speed, (2) sudden increase or decrease in speeds, and (3) following distance, were important factors to determine if the passenger enjoyed their ride, regardless of who drove.

### Feature #1: Vehicle Actions + Emergency Stop

![2 mockups showing vehicle actions and emergency button](/assets/self-driving_home-screen.png)

The vehicle's actions are displayed on the top of the screen. There is also an emergency stop button. This button requires a swipe (rather than a typical tap) to prevent accidental triggers. This opens up a screen that now requires a simultaneous swiping of 2 buttons to stop the vehicle.

*\[note: accessibility was not full considered for this design, and will iterate on this in further exploration]*

### Feature #2: Customizing Maximum Speed

Here (and the rest of the customizations), I tried to use micro interaction and motion design to indicate immediate feedback by the app and the vehicle. This provides an additional level of assurance, which directly contributes to building trust.

### Feature #3: Acceleration & Braking

People's preferences for braking and accelerating is difficult to quantify. As such, this setting was designed for users to set their preferences based on their feelings through trial and error. The interface was inspired by the gear shift in vehicles today.

### Feature #4: Following Distance

It is difficult to set a comfortable following distance in absolute units of measurement, as such, the distance is visually represented in terms of car lengths. This was inspired by my lessons on defensive driving in Singapore.

# Reflections / Next Steps

I loved working on this project because the problem felt so real yet distant (which is the generally the mixed sentiments of people who I spoke to for this project), and a huge part of this project was about first convincing myself of the viability of autonomous vehicles. 

I would loved to carry out some level of user testing and simulation to further validate my concept. I was in contact with a few people in this space and made plans to visit their offices, but these plans never materialized because of the pandemic.

Looking at this from another lens, there is a lot of potential in how the form of both the exterior and interior of the vehicle can affect the trust and adoption of vehicles (I gathered some data during user research, but never used it for this chosen concept)

If you're someone working in the autonomous vehicle space or a potential future user of the technology, I would love to have a chat about this!
