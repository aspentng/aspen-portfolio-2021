  "about": "I'm currently a product designer at the Government Technology Agency in Singapore working on Singpass, the nation's digital identity platform for citizens.\n\nI was born and raised in sunny Singapore before going to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the United States (where winters are harsh) to study industrial design.\n\nI made a 180[](https://www.degreesymbol.net/)Â° pivot from a science-based education (pre-college) to graduating with a fine arts degree, then became a product designer in tech."
