    "description": "Product designer at Government Technology Agency, Singapore // previously, UX intern at Cargill, Inc.\n\n\nI currently view design as a tool to either empower those next in line to do their best work, or build trust between users and emerging technologies."

  "about": "I was born and raised in always-sunny Singapore before heading to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the freezing cold midwestern part of the United States for school.\n\nI made a 180-degree pivot from a primarily science-based education to fine arts degree in industrial design, before ending up in tech as a product designer. Honestly, I think it's the best of both worlds."
